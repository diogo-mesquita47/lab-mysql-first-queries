7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

A: First thing that is easily recognizable is that the most rated apps are all free of charge,
which broadens the audience that is the target of these apps making them more popular and therefore
more rated. Another thing is the Genre of the Apps which is dominated by Games or Social Networking
with a bit of Music in between which is due to what today's society consumes the most.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

A: This data is very skewed due to low amount of ratings that were given by users, and therefore
it can't be considered as the "best app" having the best ratings. To find the truly "top rated"
apps one would have to find a certain threshold for amount of ratings, for example,
comparing the ratings of the top 100 most rated apps.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

A: As said in previous questions, the biggest difference is definitely the amount of 
ratings given by users, as the highest rated apps' score is skewed due to low amount of users
rating those apps. Another thing to add is, that in the top 10 top rated apps, there were
5 paid ones which obviously demand a higher standard of quality compared to the free ones.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

A:(ORDER BY user_rating DESC, rating_count_tot DESC), as shown in the query

11. Do people care about the price?

A:With the queries performed in mysql, we can see that from the top 100 apps only very few (obs: I couldn't count with a LIMIT, if you could show me how, it would further increase my analysis' value) of them aren't free, so from that info
I would say people do care about the price and are much more likely to install and rate an app when it's free than if the app is paid.
